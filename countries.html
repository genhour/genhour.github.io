<div id="uruguay"><h2>Uruguay</h2>
<p>Uruguay, South America's hidden gem, offers a variety of attractions for travelers who love nature, culture, and history. Explore the charming colonial architecture and lively markets of Montevideo, the country's cosmopolitan capital. Visit Colonia del Sacramento, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and admire its cobblestone streets and old fortifications. Relax on the sandy beaches and glamorous resorts of Punta Del Este, where you can spot celebrities and enjoy the nightlife. Taste the local wines and cheeses in the scenic countryside, where you can also join adventurous activities like kitesurfing, ballooning, and trekking. Experience the vibrant candombe music and dance during the carnival season, the longest in the world, and witness the colorful costumes and parades.</p>
<p>Uruguay, country located on the southeastern coast of South America. The second smallest country on the continent, Uruguay has long been overshadowed politically and economically by the adjacent republics of Brazil and Argentina, with both of which it has many cultural and historical similarities. “On the map, surrounded by its large neighbors, Uruguay seems tiny,” writes contemporary Uruguayan historian and novelist Eduardo Galeano. “But not really. We have five times more land than Holland and five times fewer inhabitants. We have more cultivable land than Japan, and a population forty times smaller.”</p>

<div id="paraguay"><h2>Paraguay</h2>
<p>Paraguay, landlocked country in south-central South America. Paraguay’s recent history has been characterized by turbulence and authoritarian rule. It was involved in two of the three major wars on the continent—the War of the Triple Alliance (1864/65–70), against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, and the Chaco War (1932–35), against Bolivia. Moreover, a civil war in 1947 and the long dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner (1954–89) left a deep legacy of fear and self-censorship among Paraguayans, who began to overcome those impediments only in the early 21st century. Since 1989 the democratization process has been rocky, and Paraguay has experienced bouts of instability in its military, the assassination of a vice president in 1999, and the indictment of former presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy (1993–98) and Luis González Macchi (1999–2003) on corruption charges. In 2008 Paraguay’s Colorado Party, one of the longest continuously ruling political parties in the world, lost power for the first time since 1947, though it returned to power in 2013. The national capital is Asunción.</p>
<p>Paraguay has a more-homogeneous population than most other countries in South America; most Paraguayans are of European and Guaraní ancestry. The Guaraní culture is strongly represented through folk art and festivals, and Guaraní was designated an official language of Paraguay in the country’s 1992 constitution. Paraguayans are intensely nationalistic and are proud to converse in Guaraní, which acts as a strong marker of their identity. That indigenous language is much more widely spoken in Paraguay than is Spanish, which is unique in Latin America.</p>
